# LeetCodeProblems
Project/Exam - Algorithmic Thinking in Problem Solving

## Task
For this assignment, I chose 15 problems from LeetCode with Medium difficulty.
Each problem (folder) contains a README file with two things:
* Questions I would ask an interviewer if I was asked to solve that problem, and 
* Mention my way of approaching IDEAL and using Duke's 7 steps to solve this problem.

### IDEAL
```
Identify the problem
Define your goal
Explore possible strategies
Anticipate outcomes and act
Look and learn
```
